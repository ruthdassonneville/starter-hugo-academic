# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Recent research draws attention to parties? reliance on group appeals. Such group appeals are a tool that parties and candidates use to strengthen the association between voters? social group membership and their electoral support. However, what we know about the effects of such appeals on voters is mostly limited to class appeals. Using two survey experimental studies among British voters (N=1,500; N=3,200), we shed light on the generalizability of the effects of symbolic group appeals for other types of social groups. We show that group appeals based on class, place, education, age, gender, and ethnicity all shape candidate support. We also theorize that effects are conditioned by respondents? strength of identity and their deservingness perceptions and show that the latter are key to explaining voters? reactions to group appeals. These findings clarify the scope and conditions of group appeals? effects and advance our understanding of group politics."
